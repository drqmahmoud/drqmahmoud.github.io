<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
I joined UOIT in January 2013 as Professor and Chair of the Department of Electrical, Computer and Software Engineering, in the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science.
</p>
<p>

I moved here from the University of Guelph where I was a Professor of Computer Science and Director of the Centre for Mobile Education and Research. I joined the University of Guelph as an Assistant Professor in August 2002, and in recognition of my contributions I was granted tenure in December 2004, and promoted to Associate Professor effective July 2006, and to Full Professor effective July 2011. I have served as: the founding Associate Chair of the Distributed Computing and Wireless Telecom program (Computing Co-Op) at the University of Guelph-Humber between August 2002 and April 2007, Co-op Faculty Advisor between May 2004 and April 2007, and Coordinator of Final Year Projects for the same program between April 2006 and December 2006.

Previously, I have worked as Director of Graduate Programs (Master's program in Cybersecurity) at Zayed University (UAE); Consultant and Independent Contractor for Nortel Networks and Sun Microsystems; Lecturer in the School of Computing Science at Simon Fraser University; Instructor at Etisalat College of Engineering (now known as Khalifa University, UAE); Sr. Software Engineer in the School of Computer Science at Carleton University; and Software Designer at Newbridge Networks (now known as Alcatel-Lucent) in Ottawa.</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>
I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Middlesex University in London (UK) for my work on Mobile Agents for Wired and Wireless Computing. My Ph.D. advisor was Dr. Luminita Vasiu, and my external examiners were Dr. Mike Holcombe (University of Sheffield, England) and Dr. Henry Tirri (Universiy of Helsinki, Finland, and now CTO and Executive VP of Nokia). I received a B.Sc. in Data Analysis and a Master's degree in Computer Science, both from the University of New Brunswick, Canada. Dr. Weichang Du was my Master's thesis advisor, check out the academic family tree. I have also spent a year as a PhD student at Carleton University in Ottawa.
