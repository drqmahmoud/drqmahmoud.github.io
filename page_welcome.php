<h3>Hi there!</h3>
<p>
I am a Professor of Software Engineering in the Department of Electrical, Computer and Software Engineering. My current research interests are in software systems and security, mobile computing, and middleware. I am always looking for industrial partnerships, as well as motivated graduate and undergraduate students interested in applied research projects, so I invite you to explore my website and contact me if you're interested in collaboration, applied research, or graduate studies.

I joined UOIT in January 2013 as Professor and Founding Chair of the Department of Electrical, Computer and Software Engineering; I have served in that position until June 2015, followed by one year as Associate Dean (Academic) of the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science. I moved to UOIT from the University of Guelph where I was a Professor of Computer Science and Director of the <a href="http://nextproject.ca/cmer">Centre for Mobile Education and Research</a>. I joined the University of Guelph as an Assistant Professor in August 2002, and in recognition of my contributions I was granted tenure in December 2004, and promoted to Associate Professor effective July 2006, and to Full Professor effective July 2011. I have served as: the founding Associate Chair of the Distributed Computing and Wireless Telecom program (Computing Co-Op) at the University of Guelph-Humber between August 2002 and April 2007, Co-op Faculty Advisor between May 2004 and April 2007, and Coordinator of Final Year Projects for the same program between April 2006 and December 2006.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Middlesex University in London (UK) for my work on Mobile Agents for Wired and Wireless Computing. My Ph.D. advisor was Dr. Luminita Vasiu, and my external examiners were Dr. Mike Holcombe (University of Sheffield, England) and Dr. Henry Tirri (Universiy of Helsinki, Finland, and now CTO and Executive VP of Nokia). I received a B.Sc. in Data Analysis and a Master's degree in Computer Science, both from the University of New Brunswick, Canada. Dr. Weichang Du was my Master's thesis advisor, check out the <a href="http://www.cs.unb.ca/profs/wdu/webmain/familytree.html">academic family tree</a>. I have also spent a year as a PhD student at Carleton University.
